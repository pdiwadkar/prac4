Book Description

This book approaches the real-time issues via established web-programming

and concurrency techniques, which will reveal a few deficiencies of the standard Java platform.
 A real-time package (class library) and a few run-time extensions will be presented.
  The usage of these additions to create high performance real-time control software is then
   described in a real-time programming chapter which is central the topic of this book.
